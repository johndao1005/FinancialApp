## File Changes

### Server-side Changes
1. **New Controller:** 
   - `userCategoryOverride.controller.js`: Added CRUD operations and rule application logic

2. **New Routes:** 
   - `userCategoryOverride.routes.js`: Added endpoints for category rules management

3. **New Model:** 
   - `userCategoryOverride.model.js`: Schema for storing category rules

4. **Server Updates:**
   - Updated `index.js` to register new routes

### Client-side Changes

1. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Updated `App.js` with code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense
   - Created LoadingFallback component for better loading experience

2. **New Components:**
   - `CategoryChange.js`: Component for changing transaction categories
   - `SkeletonLoader.js`: Component for content placeholders during loading
   - `OnboardingTooltip.js`: Component for user guidance tours
   - Integrated `QuickTransactionEntry.js` into Navbar

3. **Updated Components:**
   - Enhanced `TransactionTable.js` with clickable categories
   - Updated `Navbar.js` with quick transaction entry
   - Updated `TransactionFilters.js` with rule generation options

4. **Redux Store:**
   - Added `categoryOverrideSlice.js` for managing category rules
   - Updated store.js to register the new reducer

5. **Testing:**
   - Added tests for components: TransactionTable, CategoryChange, QuickTransactionEntry
   - Added tests for Redux: categoryOverrideSlice

## Technical Implementation Details

### Smart Category Rules System
The system allows for multiple types of rules:
- **Exact Match:** Exactly matches the full text (case-insensitive)
- **Contains:** Matches if the field contains the pattern
- **Starts/Ends With:** Matches beginning or end of text
- **Regex:** Uses regular expressions for complex patterns
- **Amount Match:** Exact amount matching with tolerance for rounding
- **Date-based:** Can match by month, quarter, or day of week

### Auto-Generation Rules Algorithm
The algorithm analyzes existing categorized transactions to suggest rules:
1. Groups transactions by category
2. Finds recurring merchant names within each category group
3. Finds recurring exact amounts within each category group
4. Considers frequency thresholds to avoid creating too many rules
5. Creates rules automatically for common patterns

### Code Splitting Implementation
The implementation uses React's built-in code splitting capabilities:
1. React.lazy() for component loading when needed
2. Suspense wrapper with fallback UI during loading
3. Strategic splitting at route level to minimize initial bundle size

## Future Enhancements for Phase 4

1. **Enhanced Reporting System**
   - More advanced chart types
   - Comparative analysis across time periods
   - AI-driven insights into spending patterns

2. **Multiple Account Management**
   - Support for different account types
   - Consolidated view across accounts
   - Account-specific reporting

3. **Premium Features**
   - Bank account integration via OAuth
   - Multi-currency support
   - Advanced budget planning tools
