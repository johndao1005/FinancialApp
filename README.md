## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
[ React Frontend ]
  |
  --> [ Redux Store ]
  |
  --> [ Node.js API (Express) ]
          |
    +-----+----------------------------+
    | PostgreSQL DB (Dockerized)      |
    | Python Categorization Service   |
    +---------------------------------+
```

* **Frontend**: React with Redux to manage user input and display charts (via Recharts)
* **Backend**: Node.js/Express API handles user auth, file upload, data CRUD
* **Database**: PostgreSQL to store users, transactions, and category rules
* **Python Module**: Pandas-based service (initially Tkinter prototype) to process CSV and apply classification rules
* **Containerized via Docker** for easy deployment and local dev parity

---

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap

### 📍 Phase 1: Foundation Setup (MVP)

* Set up monorepo with Dockerized backend and frontend containers
* Build user registration/login with hashed passwords (JWT or session)
* Create UI for uploading bank statements (.csv)
* Store transactions in PostgreSQL and parse metadata

### 🔨 Phase 2: Categorization & Analytics

* Integrate Python module for expense categorization (via REST or child process)
* Design Redux store for storing categorized transactions
* Build dashboard UI: pie chart (category distribution), line chart (monthly spend), top merchants
* Enable basic filtering by date range, category, etc.

### 🧪 Phase 3: Feedback Loop & UX Polish

* Allow users to **reassign incorrect categories**
* Store user preferences to improve future predictions
* Add validation, error messages, and success toasts
* Export data to CSV for user backup

### 📈 Phase 4: Premium Feature Integration (Business Tier)

* OAuth-based **bank account connection** (via Plaid or TrueLayer API)
* Create "Smart Categorization Rules" (e.g., if merchant = Uber, category = Transport)
* Add **budget planning module** (set monthly limits per category)
* Enable **multi-currency conversion** with exchange rate API

### 🏦 Phase 5: Go-Live & Monetization

* Deploy using Docker + PostgreSQL on Render, Railway, or AWS ECS
* Add billing via Stripe for premium features
* Offer self-hosted version for financial coaches or consultants
