## Backlog

Step 1: Analyze Bundle Size
Action: Add webpack-bundle-analyzer to the client‚Äôs devDependencies and run it to visualize bundle size.
Impact: Identifies large dependencies and code bloat, guiding further optimization.
Step 2: Enable Code Splitting
Action: Refactor the client (likely React) to use dynamic imports and React.lazy/Suspense for code splitting.
Impact: Reduces initial bundle size, improving first load time.
Step 6: Remove Unused Dependencies
Action: Audit package.json in both root and client folders for unused dependencies.
Impact: Smaller bundles, fewer security risks, and faster installs.
Step 7: Lazy Load Non-Critical Components
Action: Refactor client code to lazy load heavy or non-essential components.
Impact: Faster initial render, with some features loading on demand.
